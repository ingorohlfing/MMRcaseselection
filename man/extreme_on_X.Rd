\title{Extremeness of cases on an independent variable}
\usage{
extreme_on_x(lmobject = NULL, ind_var = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{lmobject}{Object generated with \code{\link[stats]{lm}}}

\item{ind_var}{Independent variable for which extremeness values should
be calculated. Has to be entered as a character.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with

- all variables in the linear model,

- absolute extremeness (absolute value of difference between variable
score and mean value of variable),

- extremeness (difference between variable score and mean value of
variable), which can be useful when the direction of extremeness is relevant.

The rows are ordered in decreasing order of the absolute extreme values.
}
\description{
Extremeness of a case is calculated by the difference between a case's
value on the independent variable and the variable's mean value.
}
\details{
Calculating the absolute value of the difference between the cases' values
and the variable's mean value is proposed by Seawright, Jason (2016): The
Case for Selecting Cases That Are Deviant or Extreme on the Independent
Variable. \emph{Sociological Methods & Research} 45 (3): 493-525.
