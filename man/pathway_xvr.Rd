\title{Plot of residuals against pathway variable}
\usage{
pathway_xvr(
  full.model,
  reduced.model,
  pathway.var = "variable",
  pathway.type = "residual"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{full.model}{Full model including covariate of interest}

\item{reduced.model}{Reduced model excluding covariate of interest}

\item{pathway.var}{Variable that is dropped from full model}

\item{pathway.type}{Type of pathway residual. \code{pathway.wb} are
residuals proposed by Weller and Barnes. \code{pathway.g} are residuals
as calculated by Gerring.}
}
\value{
A plot of the chosen type of residuals against the pathway variable
created with \code{\link{ggplot2}}.
}
