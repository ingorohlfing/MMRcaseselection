Description: Researchers doing a mixed-methods analysis (nested analysis) can
    use the package for the classication of cases and case selection using
    results of a linear regression as the basis. One can designate cases 
    as typical, deviant or extreme and use different case selection 
    strategies for typical, deviant and extreme cases.
