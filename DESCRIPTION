Description: Researchers doing a mixed-methods analysis (nested analysis) can
    use the package for two purposes. The package allows one to designate 
    cases as typical, deviant or diverse. Second, one can use different
    case selection strategies for choosing typical, deviant or diverse
    cases. The documentations of the case designation and selection 
    functions contain references to the articles or books proposing
    developing the guidelines implemented in this package.
