Description: Researchers doing a mixed-methods analysis (nested analysis as
    developed by Lieberman (2005) <doi:10.1017/S0003055405051762>) can
    use the package for the classification of cases and case selection using
    results of a linear regression. One can designate cases 
    as typical, deviant, extreme and pathway case and use different case 
    selection strategies for the choice of a case belonging to one of
    these types.
