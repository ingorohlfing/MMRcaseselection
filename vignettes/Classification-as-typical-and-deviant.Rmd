The classification (designation, assignment) of cases as typical and deviant (or another) type needs to be distinguished from the actual choice of cases belonging to a specific type. The package offers two ways of classifying cases. First, one can designate cases using an % *prediction interval* or the *standard deviation of the residuals*. Both classification techniques require an `lm` object as input. 

The approach using the prediction interval additionally requires the specification of the width of the interval. The % prediction interval represents the range of outcome values within which 95% of future outcome values are expected to fall. Following Rohlfing and Starke, a case is designated as typical if the observed outcome value is inside the interval and as deviant otherwise. Here is a simple example using the in-built `mtcars` dataset and a 90% predidction interval. The output of the function is a dataframe with the observed and fitted outcome value, the upper and lower bound of the prediction interval and the case status based on the fitted value and the prediction interval. 
```{r}
df <- lm(mpg ~ disp + wt, data = mtcars)
pi_df <- predint(df, piwidth = 0.9)
head(pi_df)
```

The designation of cases based on the prediction interval can be visualized with the `predint_plot()` command. The graph plots observed vs. fitted outcome values together with the % prediction interval. The plot is a `gg` object and can be edited with the usual commands of the `ggplot2` package. 

The input has to be a dataframe produced with `predint()`. Each case has its own interval because they can differ between cases. The color scheme is the [viridis color palette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) that is accustomed for colorblind readers and also works when printed in grey scale. If the viridis palette is not preferred, one can substitute it with any other `scale_color_*` scheme by adding it to the command.
```{r, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
predint_plot(pi_df)
# Using scale_color_brewer() instead of the viridis palette.
predint_plot(pi_df) + scale_color_brewer()
```

An alternative classification technique uses the *standard deviation of the residuals*. The command for assigning cases and typical and deviant is `resid_std()`. The input is an `lm` object and `stdshare` determines how large the share of the residual standard deviation should be to dinstinguish typical frm deviant cases.
```{r}
resid_df <- resid_std(df, stdshare = 1.5)
head(resid_df)
```

To my knowledge, it has not been proposed to plot the case classification resulting from this technique. However, it can be done and is available in this package with the command `residstd_plot()`. The standard deviation of the residual is necessarily the same for all cases and is represented by a symmetric corridor (parallel grey lines) around the bisecting line in a plot of observed vs. fitted outcome values. The plot is a `gg` object that can be accustomed with `ggplot2` commands.
```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6}
residstd_plot(resid_df)
```
