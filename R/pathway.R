#' Pathway case
#'
#' Calculation of pathway values, defined as the difference between residuals of
#' full model and reduced model lacking the pathway variable. The larger the
#' difference, the more a case qualifies as a pathway case suitable for the
#' analysis of mechanisms.
#'
#' The difference between the absolute residuals of the full and reduced model
#' follows the approach developed by Weller and Barnes (2014): \emph{Finding
#' Pathways: Mixed-Method Research for Studying Causal Mechanisms.}
#' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
#' \url{https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139644501}).
#'
#' The calculation of the absolute difference between the full and reduced model
#' if the reduced-model residual is larger than the full-model residual follows
#' the original proposal by Gerring (2007): Is There a (Viable)
#' Crucial-Case Method? \emph{Comparative Political Studies} 40 (3): 231-253.
